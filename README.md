RomSearchPlus
=============

Created this Android application in 2010. It provides a simple user interface to the most popular video game ROM file download websites, allowing users to easily search, download, and instantly play ROM files in their emulators.

It uses HTTP POSTs and GETs to be identified as a browser exploring popular ROM websites, allows users to register from the application UI, save their registration, and save and store session cookies and authentication data to quickly download ROMs on
subsequent visits.

The application uses regular expressions tailored to individual sites to search, extract, reform and display ROMs data to the user, and identifies the download, downloads it within the application using a service, and after the application has downloaded and extracted the file to the user-specified folder, the download is shown as complete and the user can immediately start playing the game on their compatible emulators.
